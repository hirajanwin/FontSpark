# FontSpark

FontSpark is a simple tool to help designers quickly find the best fonts for their design projects. FontSpark was created to help designers break out of the habit of using the same 3 or 4 fonts in nearly every project. By randomly generating unique fonts from a curated list of popular web fonts, designers are sure to discover the perfect fit for their next website or design.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or problems.
