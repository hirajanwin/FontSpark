# FontSpark

FontSpark is a simple tool to help designers quickly find the best fonts for their projects. By randomly generating fonts from a curated list of popular web fonts, designers are sure to break out of the habit of using the same 3 or 4 fonts in nearly every project and discover the perfect fit for their next website or design.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or problems.
